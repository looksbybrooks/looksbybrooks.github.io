     <p5> Hey Guys! here are some pictures of what Ive been up too lately. A while back I went to Nordik and it was an amazing experience it was a beautiful get away and I had time to sit back and relax. </p5>
    <p6> This is when I went to the IMATS show in Toronto!. I had a blast!. If you dont know what IMATS is or what it stands for then your not really a true makeup lover! just kidding. But it stands for International Makeup Artist Tradeshow and basically it is alot of different brands that have kiosks and sell their products for cheaper. I got tons of stuff and really enjoyed my time </p6>
    <p7> STAY TUNED FOR UPDATES ON MY LIFE </p7> </p>
